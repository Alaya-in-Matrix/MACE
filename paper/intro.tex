\section{Introduction}

Automated analog IC design is very important

Traditional methods using offline model and simulated based methods are not good

Bayesian optimization has been applied, and outperformed many other algorithm

Bayesian optimization is a sequential algorithm, there is a need to parallelize it

Review current methods

Beiefly introduce my algorithm
