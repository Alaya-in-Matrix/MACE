\section{Background}

\subsection{Formulation}

We formulate the sizing problem as an optimization problem

\textcolor{red}{TODO: The circuit performance comes from circuit simulation}


\subsection{Gaussian Process}

Basic introduction to GP

\subsection{Acquisition Function}

Introduce LCB, EI and PI
