\documentclass{article}

% Recommended, but optional, packages for figures and better typesetting:
\usepackage{microtype}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{subfigure}
\usepackage{booktabs} % for professional tables

% Added by wenlong lyu
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage[plain]{fancyref}

% hyperref makes hyperlinks in the resulting PDF.
% If your build breaks (sometimes temporarily if a hyperlink spans a page)
% please comment out the following usepackage line and replace
% \usepackage{icml2018} with \usepackage[nohyperref]{icml2018} above.
\usepackage{hyperref}

% Attempt to make hyperref and algorithmic work together better:
\newcommand{\theHalgorithm}{\arabic{algorithm}}

% % Use the following line for the initial blind version submitted for review:
% \usepackage{icml2018}

% If accepted, instead use the following line for the camera-ready submission:
\usepackage[accepted]{icml2018}

% The \icmltitle you define below is probably too long as a header.
% Therefore, a short form for the running title is supplied here:
\icmltitlerunning{Supplementary Materials}

\icmltitle{Supplementary Materials}

% It is OKAY to include author information, even for blind
% submissions: the style file will automatically remove it for you
% unless you've provided the [accepted] option to the icml2018
% package.

% List of affiliations: The first argument should be a (short)
% identifier you will use later to specify author affiliations
% Academic affiliations should list Department, University, City, Region, Country
% Industry affiliations should list Company, City, Region, Country

% You can specify symbols, otherwise they are numbered in order.
% Ideally, you should not use this facility. Affiliations will be numbered
% in order of appearance and this is the preferred way.

% This command actually creates the footnote in the first column

% The command takes one argument, which is text to display at the start of the footnote.
% The \icmlEqualContribution command is standard text for equal contribution.
% Remove it (just {}) if you do not need this facility.

% XXX:
% Done:
% 3.  Additional experiments with variety of batch sizes
% 4.  The paper contains wrong usages of the cite command, for example in line 30, right side. In that case, \citet should be used instead of \citep. There are several other occasions of this throughout the paper.
% 5.  The paper confuses 'Bayesian optimization' (Shariari et al., 2016) with 'the Bayesian optimization algorithm' (Pelikan et al., http://martinpelikan.net/boa.html) at some locations. Those are actually two different optimization algorithms and the paper should only refer to 'Bayesian optimization'.
% 6.  line 114, left side: the sentence abruptly ends in the middle!
% 7.  line 125: as the experiments only use m(x) = 0, I think it's not necessary to include the mean function into the GP prediction equation.
% 9.  Equation 5 is originally from Srinivas et al. (2010: Gaussian process optimization in the bandit setting: No regret and experimental design. It would be good if the authors reference original literature where possible.
% 12. The sentence in line 218 (left) makes no sense, LCB is supposed to be minimized, while EI should be maximized.
% 14. It would be great if the caption of Table 2 mentions that this is the regret.
% TODO:
% 1.  Description of the DEMO algorithm
% 2.  Demonstration of the DEMO algorithm
% 8.  Section 2.3, the first two paragraphs are not written very well and I suggest the authors to rewrite them more clearly.
% 10. The points denoting the Pareto set in Figure 1 are not really readable when printing the paper. I suggest that the authors increase the size of the markers and change the colors.
% 13. Overhead of the pareto optimization algorithm DEMO.
% 15. The paper does not mention the parallelization mentioned in Snoek et al. (2012). It would also be great if the authors could compare against Spearmint with four workers.

% Thorsten Joachims & Johannes Fuernkranz, slightly modified from the
% 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is
% slightly modified from Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a
% lightly changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew
% Moore, which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.
