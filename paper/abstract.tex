    Recently, Bayesian optimization has been proposed for automated analog
    circuit design and has shown very good performance. However, the sequential
    property of Bayesian optimization limits its further application. In this
    paper, a batched bayesian optimization method is proposed, the
    parallelization is realized via multi-objective ensemble of acquisition
    functions. In each iteration, multiple acquisition functions are selected,
    multi-objective optimization is then performed to search for the Pareto
    front of the acquisition functions, candidate points are then sampled from
    the Pareto fronts. The proposed method is compared with several
    state-of-the-art algorithms using analytical benchmark functions and
    real-world analog circuits, the experimental results show that the proposed
    method is competitive.
