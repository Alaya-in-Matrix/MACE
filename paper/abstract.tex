    The Bayesian optimization has recently shown promising performance for
    automated analog circuit design. However, the sequential property of
    Bayesian optimization limits its further application. In this paper, a
    batched bayesian optimization method is proposed, the parallelization is
    realized via a multi-objective ensemble of acquisition functions. In each
    iteration, multiple acquisition functions are selected, the multi-objective
    optimization is then performed to search for the Pareto front of the
    acquisition functions, candidate points are then sampled from the Pareto
    fronts. The proposed method is compared with several state-of-the-art
    batched Bayesian optimization algorithms using analytical benchmark
    functions and real-world analog circuits; the experimental results show
    that the proposed method is competitive compared to the state-of-the-art
    methods.
